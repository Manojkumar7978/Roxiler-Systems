# Product Dashboard

## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing sales transactions data using a third-party API and presenting the results through a user-friendly frontend interface. The goal is to provide insightful statistics, visualizations, and a searchable table of transactions based on user-selected criteria.

## Features
Transaction Table: A searchable and paginated dashboard is present where admin can search product by month and see the details of any product(s) i.e. sold or not sold.

Transactions Statistics: Displays the total sale amount, total number of sold items, and total number of unsold items for a selected month. The statistics update dynamically based on the selected month.

Transactions Bar Chart: Presents a bar chart showing the price range and the corresponding number of items falling within each range for a selected month. The chart helps visualize the distribution of sales prices.

## design decisions or assumptions
